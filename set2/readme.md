TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
We learnt the core syntax to coding.
understanding: values, variables, expressions, functions, collections, flow control and iterations.
note: the concept of functions is similar to mathematics.
Currently, unclear about the concept of loops, and how the inputs of work.
